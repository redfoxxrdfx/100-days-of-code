# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 22nd, October, 2023.

**Today's Progress**: Commited to 100days challenge.
Set up my Xubuntu WE.

**Thoughts:** I am scared of not commiting to this, I also have no time frame in mind, but I have put full stack away for enough time and it is crucial to my programming goals and projects so I will see this through.

"Coding diary, day 0:
Goals: complete my understanding of html to compliment data-analysis webscraping capabilities; be able to create websites from scratch to manifest my ideas and projects.
Engagement: be object(ive)-oriented and code at least one hour a day, instead of having fun like I have until now with python and R"

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
